# botLarry

It was a long long time ago in a galaxy far far awa, er, well, actually it was maybe 2002 and an event called "Hacker Hookup" was scheduled for Phreaknic 6.  Hacker Hookup would involve a specific gender in the auditorium at the Hilton in Nashville talking over irc to a group of prospective dates.  As part of this NotLarry build a small server in a case made of LEGO bricks.  On this server he had constructed an IRC bot that would answer questions asked by the contestants before the hackers could.

As I remember this was a good time.  As my spawn Haydeez recalls it was a good time and at a recent 2600 meeting where we were discussing robotics and playing with some parts he had scored we talked about bringing botLarry back to life.

As part of that this project was started.  Haydeez thinks resurecting botlarry as a more physically interactive entity would be fun.  I think he might be right.

2) Code controls for hardware

3) Code personality
