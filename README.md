It was a long long time ago in a galaxy far far awa, er, well, actually it was maybe 2002 and an event called "Hacker Hookup" was scheduled for Phreaknic 6.

Hacker Hookup would involve a specific gender in the auditorium at the Hilton in Nashville talking over irc to a group of prospective dates.  As part of this NotLarry build a small server in a case made of LEGO bricks.  On this server he had constructed an IRC bot that would answer questions asked by the contestants before the hackers could.                                        
                                                                                  
As I remember this was a good time.  As my spawn hdz recalls it was a good time and at a recent 2600 meeting where we were discussing robotics and playing with some parts he had scored we talked about bringing botLarry back to life.
                                                                             
There have been a number of projects under this heading.  The current is a payphone that plays recordings from NotLarry


==update==

1) payphone

  a) 3x4 keypad (7 pin)

  b) off hook switch (2 pins, activates pin 1 on 20 pinout)

  c) volume adjust (2 pins, should set 3 levels of output volume and have triggering this cycles).

  d) handset

    A) 2 pin to mouthpiece, connect to mic input on NUC

    B) 2 pin to earpiece, connect to audio out on NUC

  e) 4 pins for coin reception

  f) 2 pins that rquire 12 volts to trigger the coin collection selinoid

2) power supply that gives 5 and 12 volts

3) relay for the 12 volt selenoid

4) Raspberry pi 4




====phonehope====

botLarry will now become a payphone

The idea is I will have recordings of myself (or others) and when you dial a number it plays an mp3 
Years later my kids can fire it up and hear their fathers voice, creepy right?:)



"Some of this code was generated with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT."  When I asked the robot how to attribute it, it told me not to worry about it.  
I guess code developed from stollen code is fair game?  I don't think so.  I will do my best to attibute any specific code I get with the help of ChatGPT.


Testing doing this in rust instead of python

On a side note, I'm putting this here for posterity


"NotLarry's origin story.

I had moved into a house with my two best friends.
We checked pets on the lease because I had a ferret (polyester).
When we moved in there was a cross eyed siamese kitten and we joked that they left that because we checked pets on the lease.
We could not agree on a name.
Then  on August 8, 1989 watching Letterman the top 10 list was

Top 10 Demands of the Striking Telephone Workers
 2. The right to call everyone "Larry" -- as in: "Thank you for using
    AT&T, Larry."

I said, we can call him Larry, and my roommate said 'his name is not Larry'
it stuck.
it is now my true identity, and honors a long gone cat."
